that can be downloaded from the The-300lb-Gorilla Ender-2-Pro-BTT main branch.

Just unzip file, and open the Marlin Folder in VS Code, examine and make any additional changes you want, and compile firmware.

Change firmware file name from "firmware-update-6-12-2022.bin" to: firmware.bin before loading it onto the Ender 2 Pro. DO NOT USE UPDATED TFT35 FIRMWARE. Leave it stock for the touch screen interface.
